### About

This is a simple youtube clone where I used external api to make it look like youtube. In this project I used Reactjs, Tailwind CSS, Javascript.
While building this project I had to setup pagination feature and that's where I got stuck with. But overall I had great experience building this project and its great to see my day to day progress.

### Install

- npm create vite@latest youtubeclone
- npm install react-router-dom
- npm i react-icons
